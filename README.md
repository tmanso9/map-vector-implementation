## C++ Map implemented with std::vector

My take on implementing a map container without using std::map.  
Done following [CPPReference.com page on std::map](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/map).

#### TO-DO:
- [ ] Fix insert and emplace so they don't change the iterators
- [x] Member types
- [x] Member classes
- [x] Constructors / Destructors
- [x] Element access
- [x] Iterators
- [x] Capacity
- [x] Lookup
- [x] Observers
- [x] Non-member functions
